1. blumblumshub.py - Blum Blum Shub (B.B.S.) is a pseudorandom number generator

2. ModExpo.java - Modular exponentiation is widely used in public key cryptography. The modular exponentiation A^x (mod n) is just repeated multiplication (A multiplied by itself x times). 

3. GCD.java - Recall that the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers A and B is the largest integer that divides both A and B. The Euclidean Algorithm is a technique for quickly finding the GCD of two integers.
